## Welcome to my portfolio site

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jamesfranklinnetsec/githubpagestest/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

source code at [here](https://github.com/jamesfranklinnetsec/githubpagestest/index.md
I'm using github pages for hosting.

### About me
I'm James Franklin, I'm currently a 3rd year network security student at TAFE NSW. I'm 23 years old, I love technology, history, hacking things, culture, memes, and I like the internet so much I might be a completely digital being.

### Contact
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-franklin-netsec/) -- I like using this, send me a message!
* [email - james@whitespacetech.com.au] (mailto:james@whitespacetech.com.au) -- send me your unsolicited job offers here. 
LinkedIn isn't very good at showing off my tech projects that so thats what this site is for. Having a website gives you full freedom, although I really like using LinkedIn, so check out my profile :)
//Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jamesfranklinnetsec/githubpagestest/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
