I'm using github pages for hosting.

### About me
I'm James Franklin, I'm currently a 3rd year network security student at TAFE NSW. I'm 23 years old, I love technology, history, hacking things, culture, memes, and I like the internet so much I might be a completely digital being.

### Contact
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-franklin-netsec/) -- I like using this, send me a message!
* [james@whitespacetech.com.au](mailto:james@whitespacetech.com.au) -- send me your unsolicited job offers here. 
LinkedIn isn't very good at showing off my tech projects that so thats what this site is for. Having a website gives you full freedom, although I really like using LinkedIn, so check out my profile :)
